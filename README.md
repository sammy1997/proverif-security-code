# Security Proofs 

ProVerif is widely used for security proofs for algorithms. In this repo, I have provided the security proofs for an attestation algorithm that we have designed for a paper. While I can't go into details about the algo, I have provided comments for better understanding. I have made it opensource so that it can be available as a reference.
